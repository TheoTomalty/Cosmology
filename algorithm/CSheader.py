class GlobalFlags:
    '''
    Class that handles all of the algorithm global variables including:
        1) Run Directives: Which directories to use, train or test or output Tensorboard images, number of batches/files
        3) Fixed Parameters: Unchanging values specifying algorithm hyper-parameters
        3) Variable Parameters: Algorithm hyper-parameters that can be changed according to desired functionality
        
        All Parameters can be set using a single-line JSON string parameter file (inserted to CSalgorithm.py call using the -p flag).
        The dictionary should have keys corresponding to parameter names to be overwritten, and their corresponding desired values.
        It is recommended to only overwrite Variable Parameters this way, and to specify all Directives
        using the c-style flags when calling CSalgorithm.py (use "python CSalgorithm.py -h" for a list of options).
        
        FIXED PARAMETERS SHOULD NOT BE CHANGED UNLESS TO MODIFY THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE ALGORITHM
